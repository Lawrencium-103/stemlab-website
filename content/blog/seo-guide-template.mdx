# How to Use This Template

To create a new blog post, simply **duplicate this file**, rename it (e.g., `my-new-post.mdx`), and update the content.

## 1. The Frontmatter (Metadata)

The block at the very top of this file (between the `---` lines) is called **Frontmatter**. This is crucial for SEO.

- **title**: The main headline. Keep it under 60 characters if possible. Include your main keyword.
- **date**: The publication date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- **excerpt**: A short summary (150-160 characters). **This becomes your Meta Description** on Google. Make it catchy!
- **tags**: Categories for your post.

## 2. Writing Content

Write your post using standard Markdown.

### Use Headers Correctly
Use `##` for main sections and `###` for subsections. This helps Google understand your content structure.

### Internal Linking
Link to other parts of the site to keep users engaged:

### Code Blocks
If you are sharing code, wrap it in backticks:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
```

## 3. SEO Checklist

- [ ] Does your **Title** contain the main keyword?
- [ ] Is your **Excerpt** compelling and under 160 characters?
- [ ] Did you use **Headers** to break up the text?
- [ ] Did you include **Internal Links** to other StemLab pages?
